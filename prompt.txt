Write a Python script for real-time object detection using a USB webcam and YOLOv8 with PyTorch. The script should:

Validate the webcam connection before starting.
Use the YOLOv8 model for object detection.
Leverage GPU acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090) if available, otherwise fall back to CPU.
Enable Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for GPU inference using torch.amp.autocast.
Draw rectangles around detected objects and display labels with high-resolution text using OpenCV.
Include error handling for invalid configurations or webcam access issues.
Use a high-accuracy model (yolov8x.pt) with adjustable confidence threshold and image resolution (e.g., 1280x1280).
Avoid deprecated methods like torch.cuda.amp.autocast and use torch.amp.autocast instead.
The script should be ready to run with clear comments for each section.
